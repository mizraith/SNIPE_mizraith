1)  Install core:
https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html#piocore-install-shell-commands
    Mac, use:   brew install platformio
    or:   brew reinstall platformio

2) Install unix and unix-like shell commands
https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/shell-commands.html#unix-and-unix-like
   edit:   ~/.profile or ~/.zprofile if using zsh
   I EDITED:   ~/.zshrc    since ~/.zprofile had nothign useful in it

   then>   soruce ~/.zshrc

3) Set up the symlinks <<instead, i just used the sytstem wide symlinks that brew setup>>
ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/platformio ~/.local/bin/platformio
ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/pio ~/.local/bin/pio
ln -s ~/.platformio/penv/bin/piodebuggdb ~/.local/bin/piodebuggdb

4)  Try running  platformio --version on the command line.


------------------------- INTEGRATING WITH CLION-------------------------------------
THEN:   SEE:  https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/integration/ide/clion.html

Install the PlatforIO plugin for cLion from within the IDE.
Install the "ini" plugin as well for syntax hightlighting.

It notes that PlatformIO does NOT depend on Cmake.  Instead makes use of the platformio.ini file.

WITHIN CLION:   Tools -> PlatformIO  -> Re-Init

* BUT THE ABOVE DIDN'T WORK ....TIME TO RUN INIT FROM COMMAND LINE*
>  cd /to/project/folder
>  pio project init

-------Then I could do Tools->PlatformIO -> Re-Init     and   Clean   and Build----------------------------------
pio upgrade --dev
pio project init --ide clion
Restart CLion.

================================================
Eventually I gave up and built up a new project using:
pio project initi --ide clion

Then I copied in the other files manually, but this still didn't work.   I still had to:
1)  Create a Build Configuration (top of CLion).  Don't forget to remove "build" step to avoid double builds.
    I used the PlatformIO Upload  spec
2) I had to go to CLion->Settings->Build, Execution Deployment -> Cmake and edit the profile "Name" and "Build Type"
so that it matched my [env: xxxx] exactly.   Both now read  "nanoatmega328"

Then I did a few Tools->PlatforIO Re-Init.  I deleted all the cmake-....  folders.  Did a Re-init again and then made
sure Tools-> Cmake was reinited.  Restarted CLion.

Eventually...after all this thrashing....it worked and I was able to build.

===================================================
Trouble getting to upload on a nano with old bootloader

In terminal:  pio settings set force_verbose Yes

Then re-run build.  Still getting "timeout communicating with programmer"

Using ARDUINO the settings in this file worked for upload:
"/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/etc/avrdude.conf"
BUT the settings in the PlatformIO avrdude did not work:
"/Users/<myusername>/.platformio/packages/tool-avrdude/avrdude.conf"

--=> Time for a diff <=--    Didn't turn up anything obvious.
--> So I replaced avrdude.conf  in the Users/red...location with the new one and tried again to upload.
That didn't work.

--->  in terminal: pio upgrade --dev
--->  Then in CLION  Tools->PlatformIO->Re-Init

### THE SOLUTION
;upload_protocol = stk500v2       ; <<  leave commented out for nano328


Then I upgraded CLion and it broke my RUN configuration in platform IO

So I use Upload and MOnitor...but monitor is broken too.
